diffuse bt steps

diffuse a little bit into the new category over time 

if i want to make it a font set, then i need to make sure they all look the same

use a latent as starting point to generate somethin
look at img2img in the stable diffusion 

-- make some kind of metric that learns "how far" to go from rabbit to that

use caption to siggest how far to go from style to letter. 

Instead of using it completely, why not use the letters lattent, then mess it up a little according to needed style
this wud be similar to the inpainting etc 

make multiple sentences 
"rabbit in shape of A"
"rabbit in style of A"
"A with shape of rabbit"
"Rabbit and A both"

diffusion based discriminator:
send features from along the unet to the discriminator
add some noisy images, and the discriminator detects the removed noise 

<>
refine after its made. refine it by moving it to the letter latent. 
Use the original latent and then use the new adjusted latents to make it 

TEST USING THIS TO PUT SOMETHING IN A POSE ! 

a soft combination 
e1 * a + (1-a) * e2
added at each denoising step 

perception loss: from the paper on disentanglement


<change how the style is learned. using images is very restrictibe. need to use the learned
space of original generator.>

want it to just learn through a textual prompt, not using test images. 
<not fine tune the generator then. cant train two, dont have the resources>
<reduce the "steps" of t, will reduce resources>


NEXT
1) improve the letter readability
2) change how the style is learned, change it to textual rather than images 


within the latent space, find what matches the sillhoute of the letter
and then use that only to mould the shape

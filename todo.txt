force to generate within the area, the further it goes the less the probability of something being there

Problems
1) backgrounds are not white. (can use a thirdparty image library)
2) input images need to be diverse enough to match the letter (maybe generate input images based on given letter)


Next:
use some sort of distance thing to ensure sillhoutes are matching. this can be used not only to generate relevant data, but also 
stylize whole word. 

FOcus on area: make a map that focuses on a random area.
learn the mask! 
learn where to put the mask, such that it results in good outputs. from 0 to 1, we can make a mask of sizd 32x32 where 1 means change and 0 means dont.

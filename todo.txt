[x] test how it works by changing weighing ratios over t 
[] make it work on 64x 64 
[] understand how to incorporate learned concepts of the words into it 
[] make branches: branches that learn "style", "letter" and discriminator branch 

restrict the input noise, to something that works for us?
i can try making a noise generator. that only generates noises
that work for me.
so it will stay within "rabbit" word latent space of prelearned generatorb
but will make sure that noises being sent, only get us the required ones

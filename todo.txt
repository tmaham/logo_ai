its ruining the concept of "rabbit" i need to ensure it stays similar...
i can try to make sure that a codeword works but makes it similar to rabbit. 

fine tune on letter (or word)
use images of original concept

use somethign to bridge them 

force to generate within the area, the further it goes the less the probability of something being there

basically discourage anything outside the required area. 

also train using original generated latents. just generate 100 or so, and use it.
